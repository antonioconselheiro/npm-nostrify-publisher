# NPM Nostrify Publisher
[Nostrify](https://nostrify.dev/) is a project entirely in [deno](https://deno.com/) and published in the [jsr repository](https://jsr.io/@nostrify/nostrify).

npm presented [problems](https://github.com/soapbox-pub/nostrify/issues/6) when handling jsr dependencies during updates, so I decided to always keep an updated version of nostrify on npm to ensure backward compatibility for my npm libraries that depends of nostrify.

The recommendation from nostrify developers is to migrate to deno.
